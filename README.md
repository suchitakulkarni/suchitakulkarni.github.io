# Machine Learning Engineer: Physics-Informed and Structure-Aware Modeling


#### I am a machine learning engineer with a background in theoretical physics, working on models that integrate physical structure, constraints, and domain knowledge into learning systems. My experience spans time-series modeling, anomaly detection, generative models, and physics-informed neural networks. I have led research teams, built production-grade scientific software, and enjoy translating physically motivated ideas into robust ML pipelines. I am particularly interested in data-efficient learning for dynamical systems and hybrid physics–ML approaches.

## Publications
### Search for long-lived particles decaying to a pair of muons in proton-proton collisions at $$\sqrt{s} = 13$$ TeV
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP05(2023)228)

Performed numerical simulations and created visualisations using **Python** for search optimisation. This led to more refined definitions of search parameters and impacted fundamental search and data collection design. 

### Theory, phenomenology, and experimental avenues for dark showers: a Snowmass 2021 report
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-11048-8)

**Co-ordinated** a team of 50+ scientists to collect, organise and analyse the field of specific dark matter models. **Created and edited** final report design. Contributed to the report by bringing in fundamental understanding of these dark matter models and provided new direction to the field. 

### Constraining new physics with SModelS version 2
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP08(2022)068) 

Designed a new and improved version of public code [SMoldeS](https://smodels.github.io/) written in **Python**. The code accounts for over hundres new physics searches and accelerates the process of understanding the nature of dark matter.

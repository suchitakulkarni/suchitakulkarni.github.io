## Data Science Projects
### Time series analysis - Remaining unit life for NASA dataset 
- Built a XGBoost and Optuna integrated regression analysis to predict remaining unit life for NASA engines 
- [Documentation and code](https://nasaruldashboard.streamlit.app/)
- Aims: 
  * Built consistent time series analysis using sliding window techniques
  * Used correct labeled dataset to preserve the unit structures 
  * Tuned hyper-parameters using Optuna and estimated quantiles 

### Anomaly Detection – LSTM Autoencoder App
- [Documentation and code](https://pinnlearning.streamlit.app/)
- Built a Streamlit demo using LSTM autoencoder to detect anomalies in physical system signals
- Aims:
  * To understand and explain role of several hyper-parameters in an LSTM anomaly detection network 
  * To construct a first physics inspired neutral network

### PCOS diagnosis
- [Documentation and code](./projects/PCOS.html)
- Interactive plots for data visualisation
- Aims: 
  * To understand correlation analysis 
  * To work with binary data
  * To create a first version of PCOS prediction system using random forrest classifier

### Taylor Swift music analysis and content recommendation system
#### Data analysis of Taylor Swift's music (EDA) 
- [Documentation and code](./projects/Taylor_Swift_dataanalysis.html)
- Initial assessment of Taylor Swift spotify music records
- Aims:
  * To undestand the nature of data and perform statistical analysis to gain insights into correlations
  * To create basic visualisations and summaries in form of histograms, scatter plots and pandas summary dataframes

#### Data analysis of Taylor Swift's music  (Content based recommendation system)
- [Documentation and code](./projects/T_Swift_Finale.html)
- Interactive plots for data visualisation and clustering analysis for song suggestions 
- Aims:
  * To understand the behaviour of widgets and correspondingly use it to create interactive plots 
  * To perform elementary clustering exercises via KMeans algorithm in order to predict songs the user might want to listen to given their choice of song. 

## Publications
### Search for long-lived particles decaying to a pair of muons in proton-proton collisions at $$\sqrt{s} = 13$$ TeV
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP05(2023)228)

Performed numerical simulations and created visualisations using **Python** for search optimisation. This led to more refined definitions of search parameters and impacted fundamental search and data collection design. 

### Theory, phenomenology, and experimental avenues for dark showers: a Snowmass 2021 report
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-11048-8)

**Co-ordinated** a team of 50+ scientists to collect, organise and analyse the field of specific dark matter models. **Created and edited** final report design. Contributed to the report by bringing in fundamental understanding of these dark matter models and provided new direction to the field. 

### Constraining new physics with SModelS version 2
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP08(2022)068) 

Designed a new and improved version of public code [SMoldeS](https://smodels.github.io/) written in **Python**. The code accounts for over hundres new physics searches and accelerates the process of understanding the nature of dark matter.
